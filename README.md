# Team Tracker
![screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

## Description
This simple project allows users to generate an organization chart for their company, provided their company only employs managers, engineers and interns. 

Users are prompted via CLI on each team member. After each team member is entered the user is asked if they would like to add another. If they do, then another employee can be added. Otherwise, the team.html file is generated.
